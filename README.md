# Nurtail — landing page

**CONFIDENTIAL** — Project IP of the Founder (MOU clauses 12–14).

The public website: a rescue-first page for the founding-partner pilot, plus a
privacy notice. It is built with React + Vite and prerendered to static HTML per page
(`scripts/prerender.mjs`), so visitors and crawlers get content before any JavaScript runs.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5190 (client-rendered, for editing)
npm run build                # type-check → client build → SSR build → prerender
npm run preview              # serve the production build on :5190
npm run e2e                  # Playwright + axe (the API must be running for sign-ups)
```

| Path | What |

| `src/lib/site.ts` | URLs from env, per-page title/description, structured data |

Content rules: nothing invented. That means no testimonials, statistics, badges, prices or
founder credentials until they're real. See `DECISIONS.md` D14–D15 in the root.
